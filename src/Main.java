  // What would be a good choice of data structure?
  // ArrayList<String> I think an array list is best because it is dynamic and will

  // it's position

  // Suppose you are developing a search feature that keeps track of the user's
  // recent search queries. You want to store the queries in the order they were made,
  // so you can display them to the user for quick access. The number of recent searches is
  // relatively small, and it is more important to preserve the order of the searches than
  // to optimize for fast lookups or deletions.
  // What would be a good choice of data structure?
  // ArrayList<String> since it would allow us to keep the insertion order in tact.
